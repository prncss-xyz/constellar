# Concepts

This is still alpha software. We will not use semantic versioning until the next version.

Completing the documentation is our current priority. In the meantime, you are invited to look at the tests and the demos in the [repository](https://github.com/prncss-xyz/constellar)

## Demos

- [some optics-powered checkboxes with Jotai integration](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/react-demo-dxfghj)
- [a timer machine with Jotai integration](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/react-demo-wnzsnm)
- [a machine with effects with Jotai integration](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/react-demo-sxjtmf)
- For a simple application putting it all together, you can look at [timer list](https://github.com/prncss-xyz/timer-list)

## Roadmap

- completing documentation (most is there)
- typing improvements (especially multiStateMachine)
- finalizing interface following feedback
- machine composition
